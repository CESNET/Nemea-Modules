Anonymizer README

Goal: Anonymize IP addresses in Unirec flows.

Method: IPs in Unirec (source and destination) are anonymized and then sent to output interface.
        CryptoPAn library, which were taken from NfDumps source codes, is used.
        As default pseudorandom generator is used Rijndael cipher (which comes with CryptoPAn library),
        but if faster algorithm is needed, MurmurHash3 can be used instead (parameter -M).
        Anonymization is prefix-preserving and a anonymization key is required.

Input interface: Unirec containing at least:
                 - Source address     (SRC_IP)
                 - Destination addres (DST_IP)

Output interface: Unirec containing same items as input Unirec, but with anonymized IP addresses.

Algorithm: CryptoPAn tools (http://www.cc.gatech.edu/computing/Telecomm/projects/cryptopan/).

Anonymization key: 32 characters long string or 32B sized hex string starting with 0x.
                   Needs to be specified by one of the following ways:
                   - As parameter on command line.
                   - Written in a file which name must be specified on command line.

Parameters: -k KEY     Specify anonymization key.
            -f FILE    Specify file containg anonymization key.
            -u TMPLT   Specify Unirec template expected on the input interface.
            -M         Use MurmurHash3 instead of Rijndael cipher.
