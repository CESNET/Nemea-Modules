DebugSender

Author: Vaclav Bartos <ibartosv@fit.vutbr.cz>

Goal: Provide a way to manually send UniRec records.

Inputs: --
Outputs: 1 (any UniRec, format is given on command-line)

Usage:
   python debug_sender.py -i IFC_SPEC UNIREC_FORMAT

-------------------------------------------------------

The module, intended for debugging purposes, allows to manually create and send arbitrary UniRec records to TRAP interface.

When the module is started, an UniRec record is created with all fields set to zero. Format of the UniRec is given by parametr.

Then you can use simple command-line to write commands:
  'print' 'p'  Print current contents of the record.
  'edit'  'e'  Edit values of all fields of the record.
  'send'  's'  Send the record to the output interface.
               To send multiple records, put an integer number after the
               command, e.g. 's 5' to send 5 records. 
  'help'  'h'  Print this help.
  'exit'  'x'  Exit the Debug Sender

Records are sent using blocking send (TRAP_WAIT), buffering is disabled.

When editing the record, you will be asked for values of all fields. If you leave the field empty (i.e. just hit enter), the old value (shown in brackets) will be used.

If you press Ctrl-C, any pending send is interrupted and TRAP interface is terminated, but the module doesn't exit. If you want, you can reinitialize TRAP and continue.
