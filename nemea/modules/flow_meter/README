Goal: Creates flows from input PCAP file and exports them to output interface.

Method: Stores packets from input PCAP file in flow cache to create flows. After
        whole PCAP file is processed, flows from flow cache are exported to output
        interface.

Input: PCAP file

Output interface: Unirec containing <COLLECTOR_FLOW>.

Parameters: -r FILENAME       Pcap file to read.
  	    -t NUM:NUM        Active and inactive timeout in seconds. (DEFAULT: 300.0:30.0)
            -p NUMBER         Collect payload of each flow.

                    	      By default do not collect payload.
  	    -s NUMBER         Size of flow cache in number of flow records. Each flow 
            	              record has 232 bytes. (DEFAULT: 65536)
  	    -S NUMBER         Print statistics. NUMBER specifies interval between prints.
  	    -m NUMBER         Sampling probability. NUMBER in 100 (DEFAULT: 100)
  	    -v STRING         Replacement vector. 1+32 NUMBERS.
