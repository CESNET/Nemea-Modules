Traffic merger (2nd version)

This module merges traffic from multiple input interfaces to one output
interface. There are two supported versions:
   - normal (default) - resending incoming data as they come.
   - timestamp aware - incoming data are sended with respect to timestamp.
     order.

Interfaces:
   Inputs: variable
   Outputs: 1

Usage:
   ./merger -i IFC_SPEC -n CNT [-u IN_FMT] [-o OUT_FMT] [-T] [-F] [-s SIZE] [-t MS]

Module specific parameters:
   UNIREC_FMT   The i-th parameter of this type specifies format of UniRec
                expected on the i-th input interface.
   -F         (timestamp aware version) Sorts timestamps based on TIME_FIRST
              field, instead of TIME_LAST (default).
   -n CNT     Sets count of input links. Must correspond to parameter -i (trap).
   -o OUT_FMT Set of fields included in the output (UniRec specifier).
              (default <COLLECTOR_FLOW>).
   -u IN_FMT  UniRec specifier of input data (same to all links).
              (default <COLLECTOR_FLOW>).
   -s SIZE    (timestamp aware version) Set size of buffer for incoming records.
   -t MS      (timestamp aware version) Set initial timeout for incoming
              interfaces (in miliseconds). Timeout is set to 0, if no data
              received in initial timeout.
   -T         Set mode to timestamp aware.
