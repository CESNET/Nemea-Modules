#
# IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SCRIPTS:
#
# Test scripts are used to track change of functionality during the development.
# It expects human check of output at the first time.
# Later on, it is possible to compare result of reporter according to previously checked.
# Note: it is necessary to remove all variable items such as UUID and timestamps,
# since it is not possible to compare them using this simple script.
#
#
# How to create test script?
#
# test script for vportscan will be created as an example
#
# cd into your directory and create test script
#    cd vportscan
#    echo "#!/bin/bash" >test.sh
#
# How to create input and output?
# INPUT:
#  create trapcap file
#    ../../../detectors/vportscan_detector/vportscan_detector -i u:input,f:vportscan.trapcap
#
# write data into script (compressed and base64 coded):
#    echo "in='$(gzip <vportscan.trapcap | base64)'" >> test.sh
#
# OUTPUT:
# store output from reporter and clean it from variable info:
#    ./vportscan2idea.py -i f:vportscan.trapcap --file /dev/stdout -n vportscan |
#    sed 's/"CreateTime": "[^"]*"//g; s/"DetectTime": "[^"]*"//g; s/"ID": "[^"]*"//g' >vp-out
#
# compress, base64 code the result and write it into the script:
#    echo "out='$(gzip < vp-out | base64)'" >> test.sh
#
# TEST:
# add these two lines into the script:
#    . ../test.sh
#    test_conversion "vportscan" "vportscan" "$in" "$out"
#
# the first argument for test_conversion function is the script name and second is node name,
# which you specified when creating output data (-n parameter)
# do not forget to add test to the Makefile.am
#

# usage: json_cleanup reads from stdin and writes modified data into stdout
# It removes keys from JSON that change and sorts the remaining ones alphabetically.
# The sorting is important because of diff(1) that is used.  (Note: JSON has not fixed
# order of keys)
json_cleanup()
